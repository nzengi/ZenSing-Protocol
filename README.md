# ZenSign: Provably Secure Partially Blind Signature Scheme

## Use Cases
1. **E-Voting Systems**: Ensures voter privacy while enabling vote verification.
2. **Anonymous Payments**: Allows for payments where payer details are partially hidden.
3. **Token-Based Access Control**: Enables private access control with verifiable attributes.

## Design Goals
- **Privacy**: Ensure sensitive information remains hidden during the signing process.
- **Security**: Offer robust cryptographic protection against forgery and attacks.
- **Scalability**: Support large-scale applications, such as national voting systems or large transaction systems.

## Protocol Overview
ZenSign utilizes Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) principles along with cryptographic hashing (SHA-256) and modular arithmetic. The protocol involves two key entities: the **Signer**, who generates the partially blind signature, and the **User**, who interacts with the Signer to obtain and verify the signature.

## Applications
1. **Secure Voting**: Provides anonymous and verifiable electronic voting.
2. **Anonymous Financial Transactions**: Secures transactions without revealing sensitive details.
3. **Access Control**: Protects privacy while ensuring secure access control in various systems.

## Future Work
- **Performance Optimization**: Improvements for large-scale deployments.
- **Expanded Testing**: Further validation in different scenarios.
- **Ongoing Research**: Enhance security and efficiency.
